# Research Question

My research question is to generate a hypothesis of which factors among a wide range of prenatal lifestyles and chemical exposures affect birth outcome(measured by birthweight) using data-driven  methods. (Although I propose my research question after conducting EDA, I would put my research question on the top)

# Load .Rdata file and Data Preparation

```{r data preparation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load data using path of where file is stored
load("exposome.RData")

# I am planning on exploring the effect of prenatal exposome towards babies' birth weight. So I just removed all postnatal exposure.

codebook|> group_by(period) |> count()
pre = codebook |> filter(period == "Pregnancy") 
name = rownames(pre)
pre_exp = exposome |> select(ID,any_of(name))


```

# Data Exploration

 
1. Since this dataset is a combine data from 6 cohorts, I would explore population characteristics(covariates) and outcomes(phenotypes) by cohorts.

2. Correlation between exposures

## 1. Covariates and phenotypes
```{r covariates}
cov_phe = inner_join(covariates, phenotype, by = "ID")
```

### categorical variables

```{r cate_cov_phe, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cate_cov_phe = cov_phe |> select(where(is.factor))

# Frequency table
frequency_tables_cov_phe <- cate_cov_phe %>% map(~ as.data.frame(table(.x)))
frequency_tables_cov_phe |>knitr::kable()# name of variables in these freq tables are displayed in the plot below

# Difference by cohort
cate_cov_phe_summ = cate_cov_phe %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -h_cohort, names_to = "covariate", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(h_cohort, covariate,value) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() 

cate_cov_phe_summ %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = h_cohort, y = n, color = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group=value), method = "loess", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ covariate) +
  theme_minimal() +  # For a cleaner look
  labs(x = "Cohort", y = "Count", title = "Summary by Cohort and Covariate") 





```

### continuous variables

```{r cont_cov_phe}

cont_cov_phe = cov_phe|> select(where(is.numeric))

  ))) |>

    cols = everything(), 
    names_to = c(".value", "Statistic"), 
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)"
  ) 
summary_table_cov_phe|> knitr::kable()

# I specify the continuous variables' names in 'name' vector to add h_cohort in this dataset(I want to assess if there's difference between cohorts-especially the exposome)
name_cont_cov_phe = colnames(cont_cov_phe)[-1]
results_cov_phe = cov_phe |> select(h_cohort, any_of(name_cont_cov_phe))

results_summary_cov_phe = results_cov_phe %>%
  group_by(h_cohort) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                   list(mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                        std = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))) 

# Since birthweight is too large(also my outcome), I displayed it separately.
results_cov_phe |> ggplot(aes(x=h_cohort, y=e3_bw)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Cohort", y = "Birthweight(g)", title = "Birthweight of children by Cohort") 

results_cov_phe_nobw = results_cov_phe |> select(-e3_bw)

# difference across cohorts
results_melted_cov_phe = melt(results_cov_phe_nobw)
results_melted_cov_phe |>
  ggplot(aes(x=h_cohort, y=value, fill=variable)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~variable)+

* There's 6 phenotype in 'phenotype' dataset, 13 covariates in 'covariates' dataset and 88 prenatal exposures in 'pre_exp' dataset, which I would focus on. According to my research question, I would keep only one phenotype *e3_bw*(birthweight) as my outcome. Also, since this study don't focus on postnatal period, I would remove *hs_c_height_None*(Height of the child at 6-11 years old (m)), *hs_c_weight_None*(Weight of the child at 6-11 years old (kg)),*hs_child_age_None*(Child age at examination (years)) from my covariates list that I 
would control for. They were the only three variables in 'covariates' dataset that are highly correlated with each other. **In a nutshell, the final dataset 'studydata' had 1 identifier *ID*, 1 outcome *e3bw*, 10 covariates and 88 prenatal exposures.** There's no missing and duplicate in this dataset. All variables were correctly classified as numeric or factor. 

* Some covariates and exposores are different across cohorts(I didn't do hypothesis testing, I just used visual inspection). We should assess the heterogenitity before we could pool the data from 6 cohots. But due to limited time, I just assumed that we can pool them together.

# PCA to reduce dimensionality

We reduced the dimensionality by conducting a separate PCA within each of the 19 pre-defined exposure groups, and retained only the first principal component for all of them. This way, we created a composite index variable (principal component scores) for each exposure group, and then averaged the scores by cohort to compare the levels.

```{r}
library(FactoMineR)
library(factoextra)
exp_groups = unique(codebook$family)
exp_groups = exp_groups[-20]


for (family in exp_group){
  
  ori_comp_names = codebook |> filter(family=="Air Pollution") |> pull(variable_name)
  ori_comp = feature |> select(any_of(ori_comp_names))
  # Assuming `data_group` is your dataframe for one exposure group
  res.pca <- PCA(ori_comp, scale.unit = TRUE, ncp = 5, graph = FALSE)

  # Extracting the first principal component scores
  pc1_scores <- res.pca$ind$coord[, 1]
}


```



# Implement Elastic Net Algorithm 

```{r partition}
#Partition data for use in demonstration
set.seed(123)
train.indices<-createDataPartition(y=studydata$e3_bw,p=0.7,list=FALSE)
train.data<-studydata[train.indices, ]
test.data<-studydata[-train.indices, ]
```


```{r}
set.seed(123)
control = trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", 
                      number = 10,
                      repeats = 5,
                      selectionFunction = "best")


# Model building
en.model<- train(
                  e3_bw ~., 
                  data = train.data, 
                  method = "glmnet",
                  trControl =  control, 
                  preProc = c("center", "scale"),
                  tuneGrid = expand.grid(alpha = seq(0, 1, length = 20), 
                                         lambda = exp(seq(3, -3, length = 100)))
                )
# I chose tuneGrid here, because this command can be used for different scenarios,but using TuneLength, I have to look at all results and see which k is the best. 

#Print the values of alpha and lambda that gave best prediction
en.model$bestTune


# Model coefficients
coef(en.model$finalModel, en.model$bestTune$lambda)

resamp = en.model$resample


# Predictions for models
prediction = predict(en.model, test.data)

# Evaluation
RMSE(prediction, test.data$e3_bw)
R2(prediction, test.data$e3_bw)

```

* Elastic Net Algorithm were applied to training dataset, with the best hyperparameter of alpha = 1,lambda ~ 13.14. This is a lasso model and can select features. Finally, only 34 variables are kept in the model. testing RMSE is `r RMSE(prediction, test.data$e3_bw)` and testing R2 is `r R2(prediction, test.data$e3_bw)`.
