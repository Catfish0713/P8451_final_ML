# Research Question

My research question is to generate a hypothesis of which factors among a wide range of prenatal lifestyles and chemical exposures affect birth outcome(measured by birthweight) using data-driven  methods. (Although I propose my research question after conducting EDA, I would put my research question on the top)

# Load .Rdata file and Data Preparation

```{r data preparation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Load data using path of where file is stored
load("exposome.RData")

# I am planning on exploring the effect of prenatal exposome towards babies' birth weight. So I just removed all postnatal exposure.

codebook|> group_by(period) |> count()
pre = codebook |> filter(period == "Pregnancy") 
name = rownames(pre)
pre_exp = exposome |> select(ID,any_of(name))


```

# Data Exploration

 
1. Since this dataset is a combine data from 6 cohorts, I would explore population characteristics(covariates) and outcomes(phenotypes) by cohorts.

2. Correlation between exposures

## 1. Covariates and phenotypes
```{r covariates}
cov_phe = inner_join(covariates, phenotype, by = "ID")
```

### categorical variables

```{r cate_cov_phe, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cate_cov_phe = cov_phe |> select(where(is.factor))

# Frequency table
frequency_tables_cov_phe <- cate_cov_phe %>% map(~ as.data.frame(table(.x)))
frequency_tables_cov_phe |>knitr::kable()# name of variables in these freq tables are displayed in the plot below

# Difference by cohort
cate_cov_phe_summ = cate_cov_phe %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -h_cohort, names_to = "covariate", values_to = "value") %>%
  group_by(h_cohort, covariate,value) %>%
  summarize(n = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  ungroup() 

cate_cov_phe_summ %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = h_cohort, y = n, color = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(aes(group=value), method = "loess", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_grid(. ~ covariate) +
  theme_minimal() +  # For a cleaner look
  labs(x = "Cohort", y = "Count", title = "Summary by Cohort and Covariate") 





```

### continuous variables

```{r cont_cov_phe}

cont_cov_phe = cov_phe|> select(where(is.numeric))

summary_table_cov_phe <- cont_cov_phe %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), list(
    Mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = ~median(.x, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR = ~IQR(.x, na.rm = TRUE)
  ))) |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = everything(), 
    names_to = c(".value", "Statistic"), 
    names_pattern = "(.*)_(.*)"
  ) 
summary_table_cov_phe|> knitr::kable()

# I specify the continuous variables' names in 'name' vector to add h_cohort in this dataset(I want to assess if there's difference between cohorts-especially the exposome)
name_cont_cov_phe = colnames(cont_cov_phe)[-1]
results_cov_phe = cov_phe |> select(h_cohort, any_of(name_cont_cov_phe))

results_summary_cov_phe = results_cov_phe %>%
  group_by(h_cohort) %>%
  summarize(across(where(is.numeric), 
                   list(mean = ~mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE), 
                        std = ~sd(.x, na.rm = TRUE)))) 

# Since birthweight is too large(also my outcome), I displayed it separately.
results_cov_phe |> ggplot(aes(x=h_cohort, y=e3_bw)) + geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Cohort", y = "Birthweight(g)", title = "Birthweight of children by Cohort") 

results_cov_phe_nobw = results_cov_phe |> select(-e3_bw)

# difference across cohorts
results_melted_cov_phe = melt(results_cov_phe_nobw)
results_melted_cov_phe |>
  ggplot(aes(x=h_cohort, y=value, fill=variable)) + geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~variable)+
  labs(x = "Cohort", y = "Covariates and phenotypes", title = "Covariates and phenotypes by Cohort") 
  


```

## Merge datasets
```{r final_dataset}
# merge three datasets together

outcome = phenotype |> select(ID, e3_bw)
studydata = merge(pre_exp,outcome,by="ID") |> merge(covariates, by="ID") |>

```

* There's 6 phenotype in 'phenotype' dataset, 13 covariates in 'covariates' dataset and 88 prenatal exposures in 'pre_exp' dataset, which I would focus on. According to my research question, I would keep only one phenotype *e3_bw*(birthweight) as my outcome. Also, since this study don't focus on postnatal period, I would remove *hs_c_height_None*(Height of the child at 6-11 years old (m)), *hs_c_weight_None*(Weight of the child at 6-11 years old (kg)),*hs_child_age_None*(Child age at examination (years)) from my covariates list that I 
would control for. They were the only three variables in 'covariates' dataset that are highly correlated with each other. **In a nutshell, the final dataset 'studydata' had 1 identifier *ID*, 1 outcome *e3bw*, 10 covariates and 88 prenatal exposures.** There's no missing and duplicate in this dataset. All variables were correctly classified as numeric or factor. 

* Some covariates and exposores are different across cohorts(I didn't do hypothesis testing, I just used visual inspection). We should assess the heterogenitity before we could pool the data from 6 cohots. But due to limited time, I just assumed that we can pool them together.

  model <- glm(formula, data = studydata, family = "gaussian")  
  
  # Store the model's summary in the results list
  results[[exposure]] <- summary(model)
}
